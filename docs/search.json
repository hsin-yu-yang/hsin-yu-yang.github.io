    "text": "How Does it Work?\nLinear Regression is like drawing a line through a group of points on a graph to represent their overall trend. Imagine you have some points scattered on a graph, and you want to draw a line that best fits through them.\nThis line is defined by an equation: \\(y = m*x + b\\). Here, \\(m\\) is like the steepness of the line, telling you how much the y (up and down) value changes when x (left and right) changes. And \\(b\\) is where the line crosses the y-axis.\nTo figure out the steepness (\\(m\\)) of the line, you choose two points on the line and use a formula: \\(m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\\). This helps in calculating how much the line slopes.\nOnce the computer figures out this line, it can use it to make predictions for other points.\nRemember, the examples we talked about are like drawing lines in two-dimensional space. In real situations, lines might go in more than just left-right and up-down directions, and that’s when you get multiple slope values."
